# BU Sustainability Catering Leftovers

## Overview
The BU Leftover Catering application is a solution aimed at reducing food waste on campus by facilitating the redistribution of leftover food from catering events within the specified time constraints.

## Core Features

1. Notification System: Allows food hosts to notify interested parties about avaliable food following catering events
2. Food Safety Compliance: Incorporates a timer-based function to ensure food is not distributed more than four hours after being first served.
3. Geographic Mapping: Maps the location of events for easy recipient navigation.
4. Tracking and Analytics: Tracks metrics such as reduced waste volume, types of food claimed, number of people engaged, speed of food pick-ups, and remaining food.
